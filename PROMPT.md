I want to create an app for tracking the balance and transactions in a bank account.

# Functional Requirements
* Render a bank account balance at the top of the page
* Transactions shoulde listed underneath
* There should be a UX button/modal for adding a transaction (deposit, withdrawal - with a note)
* It should support an interest rate that is applied daily to the balance. 
* Interst rate should be a setting on the account - along with name and initial balance.
* There should be a setup flow for creating a new account - including name, username, password,initial balance, interst rate. 
* The first page users see is a login/signup page.
* Make it look nice - reasonable css/styling.

# Non-functional Requirements
* Backend should be fastapi
* Frontend should be react/typescript
* Database should be postgres
* It should be deployable to replit
